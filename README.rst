Project Goal
============

#. Have a code review tool for Gerrit in Vim
   - I like moving around diffs in Vim
#. Be able to review offline

Why?

#. I don't like the Gerrit web interface
#. I tend to have extra time to review at times when
   I don't have internet access.

Gertty exists. Why not use it?

#. The interface is sluggish. Probably related to urwnd.
#. Moving between screens and lines in the diff isn't
   awesome.
#. I AM. I'm just using it as a library instead of an application.

Today's Gertty Functionality
============================

This just highlights the things that I want to replicate in Vim and not all
of the functionality.

Added A CLI
===========

To add the functions necessary for Vim use I added a simple CLI. Hey, and
it looks like the OpenStack client output!
